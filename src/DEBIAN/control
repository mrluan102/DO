Description: Adds a boottime SSH server into initramfs
 Early-ssh gives you the possibility to connect to your machine over SSH
 just before the root filesystem gets mounted, so you can unlock any
 crypto disks, assemble/manage mdadm RAID arrays "by hand", run fsck on
 root filesystem in read-write mode, and so on.
 It provides scp as well (if openssh-client is installed on your system
 while updating the initramfs) so you can copy files to your initramfs.
